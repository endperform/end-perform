This project contains the source code for my Hugo-powered website, including the theme with modifications that I've made.

Original theme is called [Terminal][1]. I've begun some modifications including the following:

- Added an archives page
- Added a terms page

I plan on adding support for categories and cleaning up the formatting a bit more. You can find my changes under the themes/terminal folder here in the project.
