This project contains the source code for my Hugo-powered website, including the theme with modifications that I've made.

Original theme is called [Terminal][1]. I've begun some modifications including the following:

- Added an archives page [DONE]
- Added a terms page [DONE]

You can find my changes under the themes/terminal folder here in the project.
