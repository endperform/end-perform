Welcome to endperform.com. I tend to write about whatever is on my mind at the time, usually either gaming, tech or possibly wrestling related, basically whatever is on my mind on a given day.
Links to my social media are in the footer. Feel free to pull up a chair and stay a while!  

**Projects**  

* [PyRogueLike][1] : A Roguelike game in Python (following a tutorial series).
* [Github][2] : I'm working on a few projects. More details as I get them sorted out.
