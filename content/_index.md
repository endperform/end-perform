Welcome to endperform.com. I tend to write about whatever is on my mind at the time, usually either gaming, tech or possibly wrestling related, basically whatever is on my mind on a given day. Links to my social media are in the footer. Feel free to pull up a chair and stay a while!  

### Heads Up!
* The domain end-perform.com will go away in September. Please update bookmarks to endperform.com!
* [Github][1] : I'm working on a few projects. More details as I get them sorted out.
