Hi, I'm Brad. I'm a 40-something IT engineer, and here on my website you'll find my writing about various and sundry topics, mostly revolving around technology, gaming or whatever else may be on my mind. I'm trying to use my site as a bit of social outlet instead of relying on Facebook, for various and sundry reasons. I'm also somewhat active on Twitter, and other links to where you might find me are also below.

The site layout may change here and there as I continue to tweak it to my liking, but the links will remain the same.

### Social Links
* [Github][1] : Currently only contains my dotfiles; other projects will follow
* [Twitter][2] : I'm pretty active here. Definitely 18+ and sometimes NSFW
