Hi, I'm Brad. I'm a 40-something IT engineer, and here on my website you'll find my writing about various and sundry topics, mostly revolving around technology, gaming or whatever else may be on my mind. I'm trying to use my site as a bit of social outlet instead of relying on Facebook, for various and sundry reasons. I'm also somewhat active on Twitter, and other links to where you might find me are also below.

### Social Links
* [Github][1] : In the process of cleaning things up. Code will go here
* [Twitter][2] : I'm pretty active here. Definitely 18+ and sometimes NSFW
* [Twitch Channel][3] : I stream on Wednesdays and Sundays at 8pm Eastern. Games and more!
