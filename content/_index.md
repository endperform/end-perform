Welcome to end-perform.com. I tend to write about whatever is on my mind at the time, usually either gaming, tech or possibly wrestling related, basically whatever is on my mind on a given day.
Links to my social media are in the footer. Feel free to pull up a chair and stay a while!  

**Projects**  

* [Xannypix][1] : My Photography. Working on rebuilding the site and doing some re-edits.
* [Github][2] : I'm working on a few projects. More details as I get them sorted out.
