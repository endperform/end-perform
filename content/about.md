I'm Brad, a 40-something IT engineer in the Atlanta area, originally from Pennsylvania. I've been interested in computers and video games since I was a young child, and
as such those tend to be things I write about. I'm trying to write at least once a week. For an idea of what I write about, visit the [/tags][1] page for a list of topics.

For fun, I play games (both video and board games), and write code. Currently I'm working on teaching myself [Go][5] and re-learning some C. I tend to stream at 
random times on my Twitch channel, and you can see what projects I'm working on by checking out my Gitlab profile.
