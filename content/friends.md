I wanted a way to support friends of mine and their endeavours, so below you'll
find a list of links to some of my friends' sites and/or Facebook pages. Some
are artists, others are performers, and others still are just folks I dig. Some
links might be considered NSFW, so be warned or something. :)

* Bubble Bordeaux - [Website][2] :: [Instagram][3]
* Renee Storm - [Patreon][4] :: [Instagram][5]
