I checked out the trailer this morning as soon as it dropped (shh, don't tell
the boss!) and the movie looks like it's going to be great. I was half-expecting
the farmhouse to be one of the living Ghostbusters' (Ray specifically), but
seemingly it was Egon's place. I'm hoping they get into a bit of the story
about how he came to have an old farmhouse, but we'll see.

I am definitely excited to see what they've done. I've seen a few complaints
about this being "Stranger Things: The Movie", but I don't see it. It's kind of
ridiculous to draw similarities based on a two minute trailer. The other
complaint I've seen is that this movie does not reference the 2016 reboot. One
thing you need to remember about the 2016 movie is that it lives in an alternate
universe; the Manhattan crossrip did not occur in that universe, and as such,
the OG Ghostbusters do not live in that universe. This movie isn't a
continuation of that universe; it's a continuation of the 84/89 universe.

Three things stand out in my head:

* What happened to the OG Ghostbusters? Are we picking up after 84, or 89?
* If we're picking up after 1989, what happened to Ecto-1A, or are there
  multiple Ectos?

I can't wait to find out next summer.
