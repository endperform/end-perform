Welcome to the first edition of **My Favorites**, a weekly post about a favorite game, movie, personality, cosplayer, (you get the idea). This week, I wanted to talk about one of my favorite Youtubers, [Penny Underbust, aka Plunder Bunny][1]  

I actually came across her on DeviantArt after browsing around for a while. I remember seeing a photo of her as Supergirl (this was a few years ago) and so I followed that photo over to her profile. From there, I checked out some of her other social media and eventually found her Youtube presense. At first glance, I already know some of you are going to have an opinion as to why she's my favorite. Yes, she's beautiful, I'm not focusing on physical appearance here, that's not why she's one of my favorite Youtubers.  *"Well Xanny, why is she your favorite then?"* I'm glad you asked!  

I enjoy her content. Duh. Her voice, singing or otherwise, is amazing and (to me at least) soothing. I've had some rough nights, but watching one of her videos tends to make things a bit better. She does gaming videos, cosplays, how-tos, Q&As and just regular vlogs and all are quite entertaining. She also streams from time to time on Twitch, where she goes out of her way to make others feel welcome and it's really an enjoyable time. She interacts with the audience (and she wished me a happy birthday, first time a streamer ever did that :) ) and is just a joy to watch.

So, there you have it. I highly recommend you check her out and see what she's up to, you'll be glad you did.
