We're about five days out from the end of the year, and I've been somewhat quiet. Work's been pretty busy this year, and I have let a lot of things slide that I really didn't want to but time left me with no choice. 2019, though, I intend to do the things I didn't get much of a chance to do over the past year, photography being the main thing. I've got a new camera all set, and I've got lots of ideas. Keep an eye out here, or my social media to find out when I have a new shoot to share.  

Some of my other plans include strengthening my Python 3 skills, as well as learning a new language. I'm thinking either Go or Rust, but we shall see. Finally, I've got everything ready to go for streaming, and hopefully some Youtube recording as well. I'll probably stream games, but if I get serious about learning a new programming language I may take you all with me. 2019 will hopefully be a more productive year.
