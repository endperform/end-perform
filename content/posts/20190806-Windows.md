#### Xanny, I thought you said you were sticking with Linux?
Yeah, I know, but after getting aggrevated with some things not working as they should and spending more time than I'd like troubleshooting, I just ended up wiping Linux out and reinstalling Windows. A bit of background, I spend 90% of my time troubleshooting and living in a terminal at my day job, so when I get home I'm more in the camp of "I just want this thing to work, that's it.". Linux is happily running in a VM again, and when I'm doing development work or writing something for the site, that's where you'll find me.

### Rocket League Announced that Crates will be Removed  
This doesn't come as a shock to me, given the current climate with regards to loot boxes and microtransactions in video games. Since the developer of Rocket League was bought by Epic, it's a pretty sure bet we're going to see an in-game store much like Fortnite: Save the World has. Details are sparse at the moment, so we'll have to wait and see how things pan out.
