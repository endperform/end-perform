Another month has come and gone, and like I do, I'm posting how the previous month went with regards to what I got done and the goals I set out for myself.

For the month of July, I set the following goals for myself:

* Continue working on the Roguelike dev tutorial in Python
* Start looking at Go. Rust is going on the back burner for now
* Attempt to stream at least twice during the month.
* Attempt to make one post a week on the blog

So, how did I do these? Of the four goals, I only managed the second one, starting to look at Go. The Twitch channel launch is a non-starter, with Mixer shutting down and the massive amount of people over there, I'm not going to do an actual launch and instead will just stream if the urge hits me. Stay tuned to my Twitter feed to keep an eye out on when that happens. I got bored working on the Roguelike tutorial in Python, so I set that aside since I want to look at Go and other things. Posting also hasn't happened as much as I wanted to do thanks to work going pretty much insane with things to do. 

### What Did I Do This Month?  

* I wrote a Python script to help add watermarks to my photography images, which is another piece of getting my photo gallery back up.
* I successfully migrated my Bitwarden data from their servers to my own local Pi install. It's been working quite well and I'm happy with it.

### July In Review

As mentioned, work has been very busy and as such, stressful. This usually wears me down and makes me want to just relax and not focus on geeky things aside from gaming or the like. Isolation is also doing a number to me, but I'm dealing with it as best as I can, which is all anyone can really do. I've started working on improving my health one step at a time, and thus far it's been okay.

### August Goals

* Migrate from Authy to another OTP app. While encrypted, I'd rather have full control of my security-related data.
* Migrate from Amazon Lightsail to another host. Lightsail is okay, but for the price I can get more bang for the buck.
* Launch an activism / political blog. I keep politics off of this site for a reason, but I really need another place to vent
