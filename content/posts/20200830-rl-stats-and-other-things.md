### Rocket League
I had stopped playing Rocket League for a while because I was tired of the people disconnecting or just in general being trolls. I was sitting at level 970, and now I've opted to play until I hit level 1000 and finish up there. So, until that happens, I'm keeping track of matches I play, and keeping track of the number of games someone either trolls, or spouts slurs or other garbage and keeping stats on that. So I present to you:

**Week 1 of the Road to 1000 in Rocket League**  
* Matches played: 20
* Matches won: 8 (40%)  

Of the matches lost, all 8 of them had someone going off the rails one way or another. Of the matches won, 2 of them were clean, the other 6 had someone going off the rails. Honestly I'm hoping I hit level 1000 before the game goes free to play, because I can see this increasing a lot. To be fair, I could completely disable chat, but for the purposes of my statistics, I'm keeping it open. I'll post another update next Sunday as I progress.

### Other Things  
* Work has been the usual pain. My work-issued laptop continues to lose sync with the corporate AD, so I either have to call the support desk, or else I have to pack my laptop up and take it into the office (which I'd rather not do). I had to drag it into the office again today for a sync, and now I'm leaving the thing up and running. If it happens again, I'm going to talk to the boss and the head of my department about putting Linux on the thing and calling it a day.  

* Go or Python, that is the question I continue to wrestle with and now I need to throw a side of Javascript in with that since the new UI to the software I support at work involves it. I think learning Javascript will happen during work time since I have no real desire to use it outside of work, and I'll continue down the Go path.  

* Linux or Windows as the main OS. I continue to wrestle with this question daily. I took another full Windows image backup today (and did so previously to test the restore function) and it's all working as expected. I do have a 512GB SSD, so if I were to go to Linux. I keep flip-flopping on which way I want to go, but I think this week I'll finish deliberating and make the switch, if that's what I opt to do.
