My march to level 1000 in Rocket League, and the end of me playing, continues on. Currently I'm level 981, 19 levels left to go. Here are this week's game stats:

* **Total played:** 25
* **Total wins:** 12
* **Total losses:** 13
* **Number of trollgames:** 6  

Trollgames are the number of games someone either started talking trash, threw the match, or just acted like a fool. Win percentage this week is 48%, and 28% of the matches were trolled. 100% of the trolled matches resulted in a loss. I suspect I should be at level 1000 within the next week or two. I've got other games and I'm working on learning a programming language on top of everything else. Once I hit level 1000, my focus will go elsewhere.
