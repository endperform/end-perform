This month’s update is going to be a bit short, as August was a rollercoaster of emotions given it was the anniversary of my dad’s passing. I did my best to stay above water emotionally, and unfortunately did not get much time to devote to my goals I set for the month. September isn’t shaping up to be much better, so I’m not going to set any concrete goals. I do, however, need to finish up getting the Girl Scouts website up and running for my kiddo’s troop, so that’s a main priority. I’ll be posting to the blog here hopefully once a week from this point on, depending on how things go. Next month’s update should be a bit meatier.
