As of now, the site is running on a Hetzner VPS, migrated (again) from my Stablehost shared hosting plan. I have a year of that prepaid and have a couple of other domains that I can use that space for, but for my personal stuff I wanted to move to a VPS. I plan on setting up a few other things, but for now the site is up and running happily. Speaking of the site, I've started working on migrating away from Hugo and moving my static site needs to [Zola][1]. Hugo seems to break every other upgrade and I find I have to keep a backup of the previous binary around. I could spend time trying to figure out what broke and fix my site, but then it'll just break again and that gets old. It's going to take some time as I need to either port this theme, or take another theme and set it up to my liking, but you'll know when the new version of the site is here.  

Aside from that, work has been kicking my ass and I haven't had a lot of time to work on other projects I've been meaning to. I picked up an Odroid Advance Go to play around with, specifically Pico-8. I'm not sure when I'll get around to that, but hopefully soon. I also got my first Adabox subscription, so there's even more fun to be had. Finally, I plan to try to write here once a week, if possible.
