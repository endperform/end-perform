At the beginning of the year, I took a look at my current notes / editor setup at work and wasn't quite happy with it. For the record, I was using Emacs along with [org-mode][1], which was okay but I had two problems. One, Emacs and its shortcuts were getting old and two, I wanted to take notes in a bit more portable format. It's true that org-mode is plain text, but I wanted something I could more easily render if need be.  

Enter Markdown and NeoVim. I've been wanting to sit down and learn Vim for a while and I figured now would be a good time to do so. I replaced org-mode with [VimWiki][2] and configured it to use Markdown syntax instead of wiki syntax. I've slowly been working on converting my org-mode notes over into Vimwiki when I have time, but I also found the diary function of Vimwiki is quite handy to keep a log of my day and what I've been doing.

I'll post an update once in a while as I learn new things about Vim, but for now, so far so good.
