I really shouldn't say finally, because the game's only been out for about a week or so. But, the long-awaited follow up to Doom 2016 came out on 3/20, and being the Doom fan that I am I picked it up day 1, which is something I usually don't do. The game is awesome. Demons aplenty, puzzles, and gore. Lots of it. The story was pretty intriguing to me at least and kept me wanting to push forward. At the beginning of the game, the little tutorial popups took me out of the action a bit, but I could have disabled those. Some of the demons required a bit of thought to defeat, but once you figured their pattern out, they could be taken out without an issue.  

Long story short: If you love Doom, you're going to really enjoy this game. I'm happy I bought it, as even though I finished up the campaign, I need to go back and find all of the hidden items. I may even try out multiplayer at some point.
