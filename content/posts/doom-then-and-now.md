Doom. What comes to your mind when you hear that word? Some people think about the end of the world, others might think of Invader Zim. Me? I think back to one of my favorite PC games of all time. This is the game that introduced me to the wonderful world of mods (anyone remember the [Simpsons Doom][1] mod?). Wolfenstein 3D was my gateway into the FPS world. I had played Doom 2 and 3 but wasn't super impressed with either of those. I had heard that there was a new Doom coming, so I had to check into it. It went on sale during the Steam Summer Sale and I picked up a copy. From there, the fun began.

This iteration of Doom is very fast-paced, but also has the gameplay that made me a fan to begin with. Search through an area, find a keycard, move forward. Lots of enemies everywhere and gore. Lots and lots of gore. This isn't one to play with the younger kids, that's for sure. I'm still in the early stages of the game, so I can't really weigh in with a full review, but so far so good. I'm quite happy with this purchase, and I'm looking forward to continuing with the story.
