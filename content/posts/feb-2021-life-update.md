Apologies on the long post drought, I've been in a funk and just keeping my head down on things. In programming news, I've opted to put Go on the back burner for now and focus on continuing to broaden my knowledge of Python. Python is something I use and encounter at work, so being able to effectively use it is something I want to embrace. I'm thinking of streaming some of my Python learning, and I already have a project in mind. The project will also involve some Arduino and hardware, so I'll have some further details on all of that once I have a plan put in place. I'm also going to start looking at writing either a Telegram or Discord bot just for the fun of it and to give me some good experience.  

On the personal life side of things, pandemic life continues. I've been working from home for a year as of March 13th, but now that the vaccine roll-out is starting, I suspect that they'll be reopening the office in the latter part of the year. I've not missed the traffic and the commute time, that's for sure. I turned 44 this year, and I don't feel much different. The work to improve my health continues, next phase being cutting out sugars where possible. I stopped drinking regular soda some years ago, but being in the Southern US, I still had some sweet tea here or there. Unfortunately those days are over, if not for a rare occasional treat. 

I hope to try to write something every week (yeah, I know, I've said it before) but hopefully as I embark on gaining Python knowledge, I can share what I'm up to there as well as sharing some Linux things I picked up along the way.
