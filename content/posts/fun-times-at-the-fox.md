On February 26th, I got a chance to take out a bucket list item, which was seeing MST3K Live all thanks to a lovely friend. Said friend could not attend, so I ended up going with another friend who also enjoyed MST3K. For those who don't know, Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (MST3K) is a movie riffing show. The premise is a guy was shot into space to watch bad movies as an experiement, and he built himself a couple of robots to keep him company. They go into a theatre and riff on some of the worst movies ever. It's quite entertaining. Now, imagine that show as a stage show (and yes, they did have a movie) with the original test subject (Joel) and you're in for a treat. 

I've been in Atlanta for 13 years now, and I had never been to the Fox Theatre. When we arrived and got through the security checkpoint and there I was, in the lobby of this beautiful theatre. I could have spent hours just checking it out and exploring, but we were there to take in the show, and what a show it was. I don't think I've laughed that hard in quite some time. It was worth a bit of being uncomfortable (I'm not the smallest guy, so the seats were a little tight) but it was most definitely an amazing time.
