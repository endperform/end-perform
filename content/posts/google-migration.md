Google used to be all about "Don't be evil", however now with their size, that's not really a thing for them any longer. I've been slowly migrating things away from Google as I've gotten the chance to do so, not just because of this, but in order to have better control over my data and my email.

**Email and contacts from Google to my own domain**  
Gmail is a decent service, but the old saying goes "if it's free, then you're the product". Google will scan your email in order to target relevant ads, so there's reason number one I wanted to migrate. Reason two: using my own domain means that if whatever service I'm using to host the email on the backend goes belly-up or if I need to change for any reason, I can then just switch providers and not have to change email addresses all over the board (trust me, it's not fun). I'll keep my gmail.com for spam / throwaway purposes, but that's about it.

The host I'm using for email also allows for contact storage and syncing, so I went ahead and pulled my contacts from Google and have them synced to my email provider and also took the opportunity to go through and remove people I haven't heard from in a long, long time. My luck, one of those people will message me and I'll have no clue who it is. 

**What's left to migrate?**  
I'm still using Google Drive for my online storage. Anything personal in nature is encrypted on my machine before being moved to the folder that's synced, so I'm not too worried about that. I'm not sure where I'm going to go yet. I don't particularly like Dropbox, nor Onedrive. It's hard to say.
