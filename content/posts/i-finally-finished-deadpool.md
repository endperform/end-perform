This game was a blast to play. I had wanted to play this game for some time, but could not due to it being removed from Steam. I have a PS4, so I opted for a used copy of the game for that console. This game is your typical beat'em up with added Deadpool humor, including breaking the fourth wall multiple times. Weapons can be bought and upgraded along the way, and the missions were quite fun to play.  

The game was a bit on the short side, though. I think I sank maybe 10 hours or so into it, but I knew that going in which is why I waited so long to pick the game up; I wanted to grab it on sale. It was worth it, and there are some challenges outside of the normal campaign, but I don't think I'm going to go back to it. It did get a little repetitive at times.  

All in all, it was a fun game and as a Deadpool fan I was pleased with it.
