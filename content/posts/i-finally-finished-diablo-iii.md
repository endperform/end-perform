It took me long enough, but I finally managed to get through the main storyline of Diablo III. It took me forever, simply because of my massive backlog of games I've been playing. I really enjoyed the storyline, and I'm definitely not done with the game just yet. There's still leveling to do (my witch doctor is currently at level 64) and there's also Adventure mode. I'm hoping I can hook up with a few friends and play co-op, as I have yet to give that a go. I definitely recommend the game; it's a lot of fun.
