After Diablo III, I started looking at my list and decided to finally give Ryse: Son of Rome a try. It's a hack-and-slash game set in, no shock here, ancient Rome. The playthrough was very, very short. 6 hours short, to be exact, and honestly I'm glad I picked this game up when it was on sale. I don't think I would have been happy had I paid 59.99 for 6 hours of gameplay. There is a multiplayer component, but I didn't give that a go.

Other than the short storyline, the game was enjoyable to me. The story kept me going, the graphics looked great, and the controls didn't seem all that bad either. I'd recommend the game if it's on a discount. I'm not sure what the next game I'm going to tackle is, but I'll keep you posted.
