I've had this game in my Steam library for some time now, and I finished my first playthough of it. So what is it? The developers outline it pretty well:  

> SteamWorld Dig is a platform mining adventure with strong Metroidvanian influences. Take the role of Rusty, a lone mining steambot, as he arrives at an old mining town in great need. Dig your way through the old earth, gaining riches while uncovering the ancient threat that lurks below

I say my first playthrough because one of the interesting aspects of the game is that the worlds are randomized. At some point I'll probably go back and give it another playthrough just to try to grab the Steam achievements for it. Basically, you're a robot on a mission to find out what happened to a previous miner. Along the way you'll collect minerals which can then be sold to buy upgrades to yourself. It has a Steampunk feel and I really had a great time playing it.

You can get your on copy on Steam, WiiU, 3DS, PS4, or the PS Vita. As of this writing, it's only 9.99 and I can heartily recommend it. Give it a look if you're into platformers and fun indie games.
