I've migrated back to Windows. I ran into a few things that at first I thought I could work around, but in the end just turned out to annoy me to the point where I was dual-booting back to Windows and spending more time there than in my Linux desktop. Below I outlined a few things that I found an issue with.

**Hardware**  
I stream on Twitch twice a week, and as such I have a couple of pieces of hardware to help me with that, namely the StreamDeck and GoXLR. Someone has created open source software to interface with the StreamDeck, but it doesn't offer the same functionality. As for the GoXLR, it does 'work' in Linux in that it will output audio, but none of the sliders or other pieces of the hardware will work, so unfortunately it's a non-starter. It should be noted there are some hacks that work with the GoXLR, but if the device loses power, I need to boot into Windows and to set the profile again. 

**Software**  
My favorite photo editing software, DxO Photolab, does not work under Linux. I could attempt to get it running with Wine, but I really don't want to trust my work to something that could possibly break. I'm aware of the alternatives and have tried them, but they just don't click with me for whatever reason. As mentioned in the hardware section, some of the software and drivers necessary for my streaming hardware don't function, which renders the devices useless.  

Then, of course, there's games. Proton has done a lot for Linux when it comes to games, and it is quite impressive, but there are some games that just don't work optimally with it and caused me to reboot into Windows a lot. 

**Wrapping Up**  
I really do enjoy Linux. I continue to use it daily at work (via WSL2 and Hyper-V. Work took our Linux machines away :( ) and at home I use it through WSL2. I really wish I could break the Windows habit, but there are just some things I can't really give up. I have thought about purchasing a Mac Mini for everything not gaming / streaming, but right now I'm waiting for an Apple Silicon chip that supports more than 16GB of RAM. A third option is building a smaller machine. For now though, I'm content with this setup.
