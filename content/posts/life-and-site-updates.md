So, it's been a while since I've been able to update the site. Life kinda gets in the way at times, but I'm still around. Work is still... well, work, but I'm happily employed. I'm also vaccinated, and waiting to see what the powers-that-be say about returning to the office. I'd much rather work from home since I've now got a good setup going.

A better update is coming later on, but I wanted to get something out there to let you know I'm still around!
