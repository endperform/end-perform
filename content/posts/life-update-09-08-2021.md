Sorry for the lack of updates lately, life has been pretty darn busy between work and family life. On the health front, my heart is doing a lot better. I switched heart doctors and this one actually listened to me. Long story short, I went in for a cardioversion and I'm happy to report my heart is now beating in a normal rhythm again. 

In other news, I made **affiliate** on Twitch. [My channel][1] finally hit 50 followers, something I've always wanted. I'm not in this to make money at all, I'm just in this to have a blast and entertain people. If you haven't caught me live yet, you can see me on Wednesdays and Sundays at 8pm Eastern. I don't have a particular genre of game, but I try to play older games with a side of Destiny 2 and DOTA. On Fridays, you can catch me over on my friend [Remzee's channel][2] for DOTA and Drinking, starting around 8:30 eastern. That's always a fun and enjoyable time as well.

Finally, after a long while I got to do a photoshoot last week with a close friend. I'll be working on setting up a gallery soon to show off all of my work, but keep an eye out. If I get the okay to share the new work, I'll share a couple of the shots. It felt so good to get the camera out and get creative again. I need to do that more often.
