### Life In Linux
Prior to the end of last year, I decided to give Linux one more try as my main operating system. It's now been approximately a month, which is how long I opted to give it a try, and I've decided I'm going to go ahead and keep moving forward with it as my main OS. Below is a short list of things I've noticed between my Windows install and Linux:

* **Networking**: The network stack on Linux *feels* faster. Is it actually faster? It seems like it is, and it definitely feels it.

* **Configuration**: Ah dotfiles, how do I love thee? Speaking of, I'll have my dotfile repo online soon.

* **Responsiveness**: In general, Linux feels a bit more responsive. It boots, reboots and starts up quickly.

Overall, I'm quite happy with my decision to switch over. I'll write about my current setup and what I'm using in a later post, but I'm pleased, and it's working well. Windows is pretty much relegated to game console status. I may install another Windows instance in a VM in order to do photo editing. I use DxO Photolab and unfortunately there's no Linux version of the software.

### Other Things
Work from home continues, and it's pretty much same thing, different day. I've started working on a better me (no resolutions, I didn't want potential disappointment), and I've got some programming and developmental goals over the coming year. Some of those goals include Javascript, Python 3 and Go with the first two being necessary to keep my skills sharp for my job, and the third just something I want to learn.  

Hopefully 2021 will be a better year for everyone. Stay safe and wear a damn mask!
