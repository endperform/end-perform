It's been about two months now since I made the switch over to Linux (I use Arch, BTW ;)) on my home machine and I've been having a wonderful experience with it. After some playing around and such, I settled on using MATE as my desktop environment of choice for now. It's light, it works, and it gets out of my way. I was a Linux user back in the early 2000s, and KDE3 was my favorite. I tried Plasma, but it didn't play so well with my NVidia card. Before anyone asks, no, I'm not going to go buy an AMD card. Maybe when upgrade time rolls around.  

This isn't my first go-round with Linux on my personal gear. Back in the early 2000s I switched over from Windows to Fedora for a while, until Fedora Core 2 had a bug where it wiped a partition. I jumped to Gentoo from there and used it for a few years before switching to Ubuntu. I forget why, but I ended up jumping back over to Windows, and remained there until the end of last year. Thankfully, I remained in Linux at work, so I still have been using it daily and I'm definitely not a newcomer.  

I'm looking to start my old 'XannyTV' Youtube channel back up, so I may end up putting together a tour of my environment and what I'm using. I've decided that Linux is going to remain my main OS of choice, and while I still will have a Windows partition around for some games, I'm going to run what I can under Linux. My next challenge is to test Zoom and the Jackbox games out for a weekly Zoom gathering with friends. I've heard it should work, but I haven't had a chance to test.
