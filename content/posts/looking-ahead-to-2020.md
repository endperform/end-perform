2019 is over in about two weeks, and rather than look back at 2019, I'm looking
ahead to 2020 at some things I want to accomplish. 2019 in general was okay, but
there are a lot of things I fell short on. Again, rather than dwell on that,
here are a few of my goals for 2020:

## Photography: Shoot some photos, at least one shoot a month
You'll notice xannypix.com still isn't back up yet. I'm working on that, and I
have a few days off coming up which will give me time to edit some of my older
shoots and get my site back up. Note I'm not putting everything up, it's
basically just going to be a landing page for examples of my stuff.

Anyway, one shoot a month. Either with a model/friend, or else just out in
Atlanta proper. I also want to learn about timelapse and light painting shots as
well as getting to know my D7500 a lot better.

## Development: Re-learn Go and continue Python 3
Python 2 is deprecated at the beginning of 2020, and while I have an okay handle
on Python 3, I need to dig deeper especially with some looming work projects. As
far as Go is concerned, I'm essentially going to start over and try again since
I had to put it down to focus on Python 3.

## Health: More gym, less junk
I can count on two hands how many times I've been to the gym this year. Not only
am I wasting money, but it does nothing for me to sit around. So, my goal (at
least to start) is to get to the gym 3 times a week. This might increase as I
start feeling better. Along with that, I need to seriously start making lunches
for the week. I'll get some containers just for that job and start hunting some
healthy recipes I can make in batches.

I also intend on keeping a bullet journal this year, most likely digital and on
my iPad. The iPad is small enough that I can take it with me when I go to work
and such, and having it in a digital format will make things easier (my
handwriting is horrible!). Finally, at the end of each month, I'll write a post
here to check in on my progress of the above-mentioned goals as a way to try to
keep myself accountable.

## Streaming
I didn't stream much at all in 2019, but I'm hoping to change that going
forward. Hopefully I'll get a schedule together and actually stick to it. I'm
not going to try to run with trends or the newest games, but instead I'll stick
with games I enjoy and do some tech streams as I work on my development goals
mentioned above.
