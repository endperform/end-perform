Since my last update to the site, the whole pandemic thing has come, and I've been working remote since the end of March. I'm thankful I am still employed and work seems to be going as strongly as it has been. We received notification that we do have the option to work from home until the end of the year, but they're also going to begin allowing people to return to the office. I'm not going to return until at least the fall, at the earliest. I'm just not ready, and honestly I don't think this state (Georgia) is ready for that yet.

Personally, I'm managing as best as I can. I'm home with the family, but I'm missing my friends terribly. I'm making the best of the time by getting some to-do items done that I've been meaning to do for some time; I've also reintroduced the Mac into the computer setup and my desk is now rocking a triple monitor setup. Work has sent me a new laptop to replace the 10 year old desktop, so I've been setting that up and documenting everything since I'm a test case. I'm sad we cannot run Linux natively any longer, but with virtual machines it won't be a big problem.

As you can see, I've changed the site look. This is the final look; I just need to make some tweaks. It speaks to my love of retro computing, so I'm going to go with it. Some of the page templates need some love, so I'll be working on that as I get time. Hopefully, I'll return to a once-a-week writing schedule to, if nothing else, just get out what's been on my mind.
