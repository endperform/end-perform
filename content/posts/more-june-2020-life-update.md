For the month of June, I had the following goals:

* Finish up re-edits of old photos and post to the [photography website][1]
* Relaunch my Twitch channel (target is the second week of June)
* Begin seriously looking at Go and/or Rust
* Continue work on my social site scraper
* Phase out use of Facebook and focus more time and attention elsewhere

So how did I do this month?

### What I've completed:

* Re-edits are pretty much done. I am changing my watermark from Xannypix to XPX, and will host here on endperform.com
* Facebook phase-out is going well. No apps on my phone, and I check in once a week. It's helped a lot with the social media noise and distractions

### July Goals

* Continue working on the Roguelike dev tutorial in Python
* Start looking at Go. Rust is going on the back burner for now
* Attempt to stream at least twice during the month.
* Attempt to make one post a week on the blog

### June in Review

Work continues to be steady. It's busy, and I've adjusted to life with Windows as my main work environment. In my spare time I've been gaming, having Zoom chats with friends, spending some time with the kiddo and working through the Roguelike tutorial I posted about previously. The coronavirus stuff here in Georgia continues to get worse, so I see us closing back up and I don't see myself going back to the office until 2021 at this point. Honestly, I'm okay with that.
