I'm sure by now you might have seen something with regards to a female Marvel Comics editor out with [some coworkers getting a milkshake][1], right? It seems innocent enough, but apparently there are some very, very fragile males out there that took the opportunity to take a shit all over something that is, well, just a normal everyday scene. But, because it was an all-female gathering, it must be some sort of protest or other nefarious thing, right? Men (and I'll use that term loosely with regards to the filth this poor woman has had to endure), get a grip. There are in fact women who can do the things we can do, and yes, can do those things even better. I've got news for you, sexual identification is in no way an indication on whether or not someone is good at something or not. It also is not an indication on whether or not someone is a 'fake' geek, or other worse assumptions.

*Oh Xanny, you're now an SJW, aren't you? You're a feminist prick!*  
If that's how you want to look at me now, fine, go right ahead. However, considering I have a daughter and I would love for her to grow up in a world where she is seen as an equal, not as a walking sex machine or as inferior, you can bet your ass I'm going to stand up for her, and all of my female friends' rights and call out idiocy when I see it. It's a work in progress for me, but I'm trying to be a better ally. I'm getting tired of seeing women in general getting attacked for no other reason other than the fact that they are female. Case in point, last year's Ghostbusters: Answer the Call. As soon as it was announced that the cast would be women, people started going batshit crazy and hating on it. Originally I didn't know what to make of it and hoped they stayed true to form, but not once did I feel that the female leads were going to be an issue. I remember going to see this movie vividly. The first time I got to see it with my lovely friend Allison, and we both loved it. I could tell she was moved by it, and I was happy to have her there watching with me. The second time, I took my daughter. She was already a Ghostbusters fan due to me being a fan of the original, and it was amazing to watch with her, and how she instantly wanted to be Holtzmann. She had a big-screen hero that she could relate to, and that makes me happy. So, if supporting my friends, and my daughter makes me a prick, so be it.

To the women in my life (friends, family, acquaintences) please let me know if there's something more I can do to support you. I think I'll have a milkshake in support tonight.
