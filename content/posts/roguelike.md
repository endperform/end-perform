My day job consists of a various amount of things. System administration, troubleshooting, code development, basically I'm an IT jack of all trades. One of my favorite things, though, is Python. Of late I haven't been able to sink my teeth into a project of my own, instead I end up maintaining older projects. I like to keep my skills sharp, and I also need to begin transitioning to Python 3, so the time has come for a project. Enter [/r/roguelikedev Does the Complete Roguelike Tutorial][1] series on Reddit. Right now week 1 is wrapping up, and I have a single character that can move around the screen. My end goal is to have a working codebase I can reference and eventually port over to Go (which I'm in the process of learning).
