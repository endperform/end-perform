It's been a while since I've had a chance to write. Work has been pretty much off the rails of late which in turn tends to stress me out and make me less likely to indulge in other technical projects and things, such as the site here. October 13th marked 5 months of working from home and at this point I'm pretty used to it. My employer may end up modifying the work from home policy, and if they do I think I'm going to go ahead and take full advantage of it. The money and time I've saved by not sitting in Atlanta traffic has been great, not to mention the money saved from not having to eat out all of the time. The biggest thing I like though is the lack of traffic. Atlanta traffic is such that I'd spend at least 1.5 to 2 hours of my day each day sitting in the car. The downside now is that I'm starting to get behind in the podcasts I listen to. I'm currently searching for a decent podcast player for Windows so I can catch up during the day.  

In other tech news, I've reformatted the Mac Mini which is now running Debian 10. It will be replacing the Pi as the home server since it seems a lot of the Docker containers I want to utilize only come in x86 flavor, and I don't want to spend hours and hours to get something working. The Mini should have a bit more horsepower as well which is an added bonus. I plan on hosting a Standard Notes server and centralizing all of the cloud backups on it as well as a few other yet to be determined functions. 

Not much else going on right now, really. I should have a better update soon.
