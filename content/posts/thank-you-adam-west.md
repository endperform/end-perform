Adam West passed away earlier this month, and that was a hard one to fathom. He was the first Batman I recall seeing, and I have fond memories of watching Batman '66 with friends during a sleepover during my childhood. He was also responsible for my love of comics, because I had to find out more about Batman and that got me into other things as well. The weekend of his passing, I watched Batman '66 again, and yes while it's campy as ever, it's still a very enjoyable movie to me. I think at some point I'm going to sit my 9 year old daughter down and see what she thinks of it.

Long story short, thank you Adam West for your influence on this geek's life.
