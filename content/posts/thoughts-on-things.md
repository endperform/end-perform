Contrary to popular opinion, I still exist! I'm finally getting back to a point where I can interact online and such. I've been busy with a huge project at work and it's finally over and done with. So, first thing I did was revamp the website design back to one of the older (and honestly my favorite) design and remove some of the older posts that didn't make sense to keep. My goal now is to try to write something at least once a week or so.

As far as personal projects go, I've got a few things going on. First, I bought an old PS3 for a cheap price. The motherboard is in decent shape, as are the internals, but there are a few issues. The biggest is that the HDMI port is hosed. I've got a replacement coming for that and I'll be taking a trip to the local Makerspace to use some of their tools since I don't have the proper desoldering / heat tools I need to remove the old port. One good thing about disassembling the PS3 was that I was able to do a deep clean on the parts and I'll also be re-applying the thermal compound when I reassemble it. Next, I've finally gotten started with my [streaming][1] hobby. I know I'm not going to be a big star, but it's something I enjoy doing. Watch my Twitter for when I go live, but usually it's in the evenings around 9pm eastern. I'll eventually be posting replays over on my Youtube channel once I revamp it. Most of my streams will be game related, but once I figure out a decent camera to get I may be streaming some of my electronics exploits as well. Time will tell on that though.

Anyway, enough for now. I'll be posting a bit more regularly now, so stay tuned!
