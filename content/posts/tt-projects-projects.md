I'm starting to look at some projects that I've had on the back burner due to work stress and other things, simply because one can not video game with all of their free time.  I
mean, you could, but if there's other stuff that interests you too, you don't want to have your time monopolized by one thing. I came to the realization that's what has been
happening, so I'm going to fix that. Here'swhat I've got cooking as far as projects go:

## Xannypix - Photography Portfolio
I've got a separate blog post planned about switching away from Adobe, but one of the downsides is that it seems most of my edits from the past 9 years of shooting are gone.
Thankfully I've got the originals at my disposal, so it's not a big deal and I actually look at this as an opportunity to revisit some photos and re-edit with some things I've
learned along the way. Work on this has begun; once I get some of the photos uploaded I'll post an update.

## Home Server
Currently, I've got a standalone NAS running to which I back a few items up to. No one else in the house is using it at the moment, and I've got some other plans. I picked up a
Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB for use as a low-powered home server. I'm looking to possibly replace the NAS with an off-site solution (Backblaze, perhaps) and then decommission the standalone
NAS. On the Pi, I want to run a webserver and host a couple of apps on it, possibly PiHole. This is still in the early stages as I still need to plan out exactly what I want running
on the home server.

## Calendar / Chore Displayboard
The minion, my 12 year old, seems to have some issues with regards to remembering what her chores are and what she needs to be doing. A whiteboard doesn't seem to cut it, and I've
got a 64x32 LED matrix laying around that might be a good fit for this. The other option is I have a 7" LCD monitor, so perhaps the combination of a Pi and that set up in her room
might get the job done. Overkill? Perhaps, but it's a fun project to ponder.

So, these are a few of the things I've got brewing. Keep an eye here or on my [Twitter][1] for updates.
