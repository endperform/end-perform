It's been a while since I've written anything, and I apologize for that. Work has been quite busy for me, so I haven't had time to write. So, what have I been playing lately?

**Doom (2016)**  
I finally finished up Doom since I last wrote, and I loved every minute of the game. Fast paced, beautiful and lots of blood and gore, just as Doom should be. I still have it  installed because I want to check out Multiplayer as well as the Arcade and Snapmap modes. I definitely recommend it.

**Rocket League**  
I'm closing in on 1000 hours of gameplay, I just can't stop playing this. It's so much fun, well, to a point. Ranked mode tends to get annoying after a while once you get into a couple of games with people who get completely bent out of shape at the drop of the hat. The rage some people have is astounding.

**Overwatch**  
I'm loving this game, it's so much fun. I'm around level 43 or so right now, and I still haven't stepped into competitive. I'm not sure I ever will, either. Quick play and arcade mode are very fun in their own right.

Check back next week for more writing. The writing bug is finally hitting me. :)
